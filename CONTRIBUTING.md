# Contributing to the LightNet Docs

This guide helps writers keep the documentation consistent.

## Punctuation

- **Apostrophe** We use `'` in contractions such as `let's`. Do not use `â€™`. The straight apostrophe is easier to type on non-English keyboards.

## Terminology

For definitions of common terms used across the docs, see the [Glossary](./GLOSSARY.md).
