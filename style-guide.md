# Style guide

## Punctuation

- **Apostrophe** We use `'` e.g. inside `let's`. We do not use `’`. We use `'` because this is easier to find on a non english keyboard.

## Terms

This is the terms we use throughout our docs:

- **Administration UI**: for the admin ui.
- **Media site**: to refer to a LightNet website.
- **Terminal**: to refer to a Command Line Interface.
