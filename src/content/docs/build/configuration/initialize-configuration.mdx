description: How to configure your LightNet site with the `astro.config.mjs` file.
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The primary configuration file for your LightNet project is `astro.config.mjs`. 
This file defines global configurations for your site, such as the title, languages, base URL, and more.

Here is a minimal version of an `astro.config.mjs` file for a LightNet site:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      title: "x.site.title",
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          label: "English",
          isDefaultSiteLanguage: true,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This configuration highlights the essential settings for every site built with LightNet. Customize them to match your 
ministry's needs.

<Steps>
1. **Site** -
   The `site` property defines the base URL for your website. Update this to reflect your deployment URL.
   ```js
   site: "https://yourdomain.com"
   ```

2. **Title** -
   The `title` property sets the site title, which appears in the browser tab and header bar. 
   You can use a fixed string or a [translation key](/build/i18n/fundamentals#translating-pages-in-lightnet). 
   Using a translation key like `"x.site.title"` allows the title to adapt based on the current site language.
   ```js
   title: "x.site.title"
   ```
   To modify the translation key's value, use the files located in `src/translation/`.

3. **Languages** -
   This section defines the available languages for your site. 
   It includes both site and content languages. Refer to the [Internationalization Guide](/build/i18n/fundamentals) for more 
   details on managing languages.
   
   In the Sk8-Ministry example, languages are declared as a variable to also pass them to the 
   [Administration UI config](/content/administration-ui). {/* ToDo: link to admin-UI or to admin-UI config?*/}
   This approach ensures consistency between both integrations.
</Steps>

There is more configuration available. Use the other guides of this chapter to customize your site even further.
