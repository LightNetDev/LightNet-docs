description: Reference for LightNet Astro Integration in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

You configure the LightNet Astro integration in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      /* Your config here */
    }),
  ],
});
```

These are the available options:

### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"x.site.title"` \
required: `true`

The title of your site. For example shown on the the header bar.
It can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

### `languages`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ code: "en", label: "English", isDefaultSiteLanguage: true }]` \
required: `true`

The site and content languages of your site.

#### languages: `code`

type: `string` \
example: `"en"` \
required: `true`

The [IETF BCP-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) code of the language. This code is used as the language's identifier.

#### languages: `label`

type: `string` \
example: `"English"` \
required: `true`

The name of the language. This is used as the language name in the language picker. It can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### languages: `isSiteLanguage`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false`

Configure this language to be available as a site language. It shows up in the language picker in the menu bar.
You do not need to set this, if you set `isDefaultSiteLanguage` to true.

#### languages: `isDefaultSiteLanguage`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false`

If you set this to `true`, the language is used as the default site language.
You must set exactly one language to be the default language. The default site language is used:

- As the fallback language if a translation is not available for the current locale.
- As the default language when the user navigates to the root URL path (`/`).

### `logo`

type: `object` \
example: `{ src: "./src/assets/logo.png" }` \
required: `false`

The logo of your site to be shown in the header bar next to the site title.

#### logo: `src`

type: `string` \
example: `"./src/assets/logo.png"` \
required: `true`

The path to the logo image. Provide a path to an image inside `src/assets`. Supported formats include `jpg`, `png`, `svg` and `webp`.  
LightNet optimizes the image size for better performance (except for SVGs). We recommend providing an image file with a width and height of 150 pixels.

#### logo: `alt`

type: `string` \
example: `"x.logo.alt"` \
required: `false`

The alt text of the logo. This is used if the logo image is not available or if the user has disabled images, for example when using a screen reader.
The value of the `alt` attribute can either be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### logo: `size`

type: `number` \
example: `30` \
required: `false` \
default: `28`

The size of the logo in the header bar in pixels. This is applied to the shorter side of the logo image.

#### logo: `replacesTitle`

type: `number` \
example: `30` \
required: `false` \
default: `false`

If set to `true`, no title will show next to the logo on the header bar. Additionally, to support screen readers, the site title
is set to the logo's `alt` attribute. Use this option if your logo already includes your site title.

### `favicon`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ rel: "icon", href: "favicon.ico" }]` \
required: `false`

The favicon of your site. Favicon is a small icon displayed in the browser tab and bookmarks.

LightNet's API supports multiple favicon formats. Each entry in the `favicon` array maps to an HTML `<link>` element. For example:

Input:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2-8}
lightnet({
  favicon: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "favicon.ico",
      sizes: "32x32",
    },
  ],
});
```

Maps to the following HTML:

```html {2}
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="32x32" />
</head>
```

<Aside>
  LightNet automatically determines the `type` attribute based on the file
  extension in the `href`.
</Aside>

#### favicon: `href`

type: `string` \
example: `"/favicon.svg"` \
required: `true`

Reference the favicon. This must be a path to an image inside the `public/` directory.

#### favicon: `rel`

type: `"icon" | "apple-touch-icon"` \
example: `"icon"` \
required: `false` \
default: `"icon"`

This sets the rel attribute of the favicon.
Refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-rel) for more information.

#### favicon: `sizes`

type: `string` \
example: `"32x32"` \
required: `false`

This sets the sizes attribute of the favicon.
Refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-sizes) for more information.

### `manifest`

type: `string` \
example: `"/manifest.json"` \
required: `false`

This sets the manifest of the site. The file must be inside the `public/` directory.

<Aside>
  The manifest is a standardized JSON file that describes a web application. More
  information can be found in the [MDN
  documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
</Aside>

### `mainMenu`

type: `array` \
example: `[{ href: "/about", label: "x.navigation.about" }]` \
required: `false`

This sets the main menu of the site. It is expected to be an array with at least one entry.
Each entry is an object with the following properties:

#### mainMenu: `href`

type: `string` \
example: `"/about"` \
required: `true`

The link attribute of the main menu entry. The value can be an internal or an external link.
Internal links are automatically prefixed with the current locale.

#### mainMenu: `label`

type: `string` \
example: `"x.navigation.about"` \
required: `true`

The label of the main menu entry. The value can be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.

#### mainMenu: `requiresLocale`

type: `boolean` \
example: `false` \
required: `false` \
default: `true`

Internal links are by default prefixed with the current locale (e.g., `/media` becomes `/en/media` for English).  
To disable this, set `requiresLocale` property to `false`.

You don't need to set this option for external links (e.g. https://wikipedia.org) since they won't be prefixed anyways.

### `internalDomains`

type: `array` \
example: `[ "files.your-domain.com" ]` \
required: `false`

The internal domains of the site. This is used to determine if an URL is internal or external.

For example if you want to link to your files on a different domain e.g. on a subdomain `files.your-domain.com`, you can add it to the `internalDomains` array.
A link to `https://files.your-domain.com/file.pdf` won't be treated as an external link.

### `headComponent`

type: `string` \
example: `"./src/components/MyHeadTag.astro"` \
required: `false`

Path to an Astro component to be added to the HTML head element of all pages. 

For example this component would add a script to every page:


```astro title="/src/components/MyHeadTag.astro"
---
---
<script src="my-js-file.js" defer></script>
```

### `footerComponent`

type: `string` \
example: `"./src/components/MyFooter.astro"` \
required: `false`

Path to an Astro component to be added at the bottom of all pages. 
Here is a [guide on how to use the footer](/build/pages/footer).

### `searchPage`

type: `object` \
example: `{ filterByLocale: true }` \
required: `false`

Search page related settings.

#### searchPage: `filterByLocale`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false` \
default: `false`

If you set this to `true`, the search results are initially filtered by the current site language.
The filter is applied when at least one media item is associated with that language. Users are still able to change
the language filter's value. By default the language filter is initially set to "All languages".



#### searchPage: `hideHeaderSearchIcon`

type: `boolean` \
example: `true` \
required: `false` \
default: `false`

Set to `true`, this will remove the search magnifier icon from the header bar. This setting won't remove
the search page on `/media`.
