description: How to add a logo to your LightNet site's header bar.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


The logo appears next to your site name in the header bar. It is optional, but recommended.

![logo](./images/logo.webp)

Set the path to an image inside the `./src/assets` folder (or a subfolder). Supported formats include `svg`, `jpg`, `png`, and `webp`.  
LightNet optimizes the image size for better performance. We recommend providing a image file with a width and height of 150px.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={5}
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      // ...
      logo: { src: "./src/assets/logo.png" },
    }),
  ],
})
```

<Aside>
  The logo will be scaled down to approximately 28x28 pixels, 
  so please ensure it doesn't include any text or intricate details. 
  Additionally, use a design with strong contrast against a white background for optimal visibility.
