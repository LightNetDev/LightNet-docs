The `SearchSection` component allows you to add a powerful search interface to your LightNet page. It includes search filters and displays the matching results automatically.

![Search Section Example](./images/search.webp)

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the component:

```astro
---
import { Page, SearchSection } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
  <SearchSection />
</Page>
```

## Reference

The `SearchSection` component extends the functionality of the [Section component](/build/pages/section), 
so you can use all the same props to control layout, title, and appearance.
