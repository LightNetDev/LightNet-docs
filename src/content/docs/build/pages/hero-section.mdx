    How to add a hero section to your LightNet media site.
    The hero image is a large image that takes up the full width of the screen with a big centered title on top of it.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"


The hero image is the eye catcher that users see when they visit your page. 
It is a large image that takes up the full width of the screen with a big centered title on top of it.

![Hero Image](./images/hero.webp)

You can add a hero image to your page by adding the following code:

```astro
---
import { Page, HeroSection } from "lightnet/components"
import heroImage from "../../assets/hero.jpg"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---

<Page>
    <HeroSection
        image={heroImage}
        title={t("x.hero.title")}
        subtitle={t("x.hero.subtitle")}
        titleSize="xl"
        subtitleSize="xl"
    />
</Page>
```

Make sure you add your image to the `src/assets` folder and import it at the top of the file.
We suggest to add a landscape oriented image that is at least 3000 pixels wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices.
The image is automatically optimized for performance. LightNet shows the full width of image but centers it vertically behind the 
hero section. So the visible portion of the image depends on the screen width.

<Aside type="caution">
Test how the component is displayed on different screen widths.

If your site is multilingual, make sure you pass a translated string for the `title` and `subtitle` properties. 

Choose a font size for your title and subtitle according to their length. The available sizes are `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
The default for both sizes is `md`.
