import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

If you have some content to highlight you can use the `HighlightSection` component. This component will display a large 
image with a title, a description and a optional link to another page. 

![Highlight Image](./images/HighlightImage.png)

It already includes a `Section` component to handle the layout. Here is an example on how to use it:

```astro
---
import { Page, HighlightSection } from "lightnet/components"
import highlightImage from "../../assets/highlightImage.jpg"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
    <HighlightSection
        image={highlightImage}
        title={t("x.highlight.title")}
        text={t("x.highlight.text")}
        link={{
            href: {`/${Astro.currentLocale}/some-page`},
            text: {t("x.highlight.link")},
        }}
    />
</Page>
```

Make sure you add your image to the `src/assets` folder and import it at the top of the file. 
We recommend to use a image that is at least 1500 pixels wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices. The 
image will be optimized for performance. Supported Image formats are `jpg`, `png`, `webp`.

<Aside type="caution">
Test how the component is displayed on different screen widths.

For multilingual sites make sure to pass a translated string for the `title`, `text` properties.
