    How to add a highlight section to your LightNet page. This component displays a large image with a title, 
    a description and an optional link to another page.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

If you have some content to highlight you can use the `HighlightSection` component. This component displays a large 
image with a title, a description and an optional link to another page. 

![Highlight Image](./images/highlight.webp)

It already includes a `Section` component to handle the layout. Here is an example on how to use it:

```astro
---
import { Page, HighlightSection } from "lightnet/components"
import highlightImage from "../../assets/highlightImage.jpg"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
    <HighlightSection
        image={highlightImage}
        title={t("x.highlight.title")}
        text={t("x.highlight.text")}
        link={{
            href: `/${Astro.currentLocale}/some-page`,
            text: t("x.highlight.link"),
        }}
    />
</Page>
```

Make sure you add your image to the `src/assets` folder and import it at the top of the file. 
We recommend to use an image that is at least 1500 pixels wide to ensure that it looks good on all devices. The 
image is optimized for performance. Supported Image formats are `jpg`, `png`, `webp`.

<Aside type="caution">
Test how the component is displayed on different screen widths.
</Aside>

For multilingual sites make sure to pass a translated string for the `title`, `text` properties.

### Add Custom Components

Add your own Components to the HighlightSection by wrapping them inside the HighlightSection.
Your components will be added below the text.

For example this is how you could add two links (they still need some styling):

```astro {6,7}
<HighlightSection
  image={highlightImage}
  title={t("x.highlight.title")}
  text={t("x.highlight.text")}
>
  <a href="https://bibleproject.com/">{t("x.home.bible-project")}</a>
  <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/">{t("x.home.jesus-film")}</a>
</HighlightSection>
```
