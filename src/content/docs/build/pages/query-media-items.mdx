title: Query media items

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

For components like the `MediaGallerySection` or the `MediaList` you need a selection
of media items. There are three different ways how to create a selection. 

- **getEntry**: Astro function to load a single item of an Astro content collection.
- **getCollection**: Astro function to filter items of an Astro content collection.
- **getMediaItems**: LightNet function to simplify filtering media items.

Here are examples for creating a selection of media items.

## Create a selection by media item IDs

```astro
---
import { getEntry } from "astro:content"

const items = [
  await getEntry("media", "faithful-freestyle--en"),
  await getEntry("media", "ollie-with-integrity--en"),
]
---
```

This example creates a selection of two media items by their identifiers using Astro's `getEntry`.
Find more information on `getEntry` and `getCollection` 
on the [Astro docs on content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#querying-collections).

## Create a selection using `getMediaItems`

```astro
---
import { getMediaItems } from "lightnet/content"

const items = await getMediaItems({
  where: { type: "book", language: "en" },
  orderBy: "dateCreated",
  limit: 10
})
---
```

The `getMediaItems` function helps to query media items. It takes a sql-like query object as an argument. 
The example filters for all media items that have the media-type `book` and the language `en`. 
It orders them by the date they were created (newest first) and limits the result to 10 items.

<Aside type="tip">
You can use Astro's `Astro.currentLocale` to query media items matching the current site language.

### `where`

all matching attributes are returned.

#### where: `type`

### `orderBy`

- `dateCreated` - sorts based on the `dateCreated` attribute from newest to oldest.
- `title` -  sorts based on the media item title
- none - sorts based on the media item identifier (as defined by the content JSON file name), the order of collection items is taking precedence.
