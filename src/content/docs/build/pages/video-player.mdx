import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

The `VideoPlayer` component is used to display a video on your page. To implement it, use the section component to fit 
the video player into your page structure like this:

```astro
---
import { Page, Section, VideoPlayer } from "lightnet/components"
import VideoImage from "../../assets/video-image.webp"

const { t } = Astro.locals.i18n
---
<Page>
  <Section title={t("x.video.title")}>
    <VideoPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234" />
  </Section>
</Page>
```

<Aside type="tip">
We highly recommend using a video hosting platform like YouTube or Vimeo because they have the better performance. 
Nevertheless it is also possible to host mp4 videos yourself but be aware you need an [additional file storage](/deploy/file-storage).

## Reference

The `VideoPlayer` component has the following properties:

### `url`

type: `string` \
example: `"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234"` \
required: `true`

The source of the video that is shown. This can either be an external link to YouTube or Vimeo or a link to an 
mp4 file hosted on your server.

### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"Your Great Video"` \
required: `false`

This title is only used for screen readers. For setting a title on top of the video use the `title` of the section.


### `image`

type: `ImageMetadata` \
example: `import VideoImage from "../../assets/video-image.jpg"` \
required: `false`

The image is used as a preview. In case you use a mp4 video. Supported formats include `jpg`, `png` and `webp`.
