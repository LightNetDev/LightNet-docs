The homepage is the first page that users see when they visit your site. You can customize the homepage
to include a hero image, a media item gallery or add your own components...

You have [two different options](/build/pages/fundamentals/#defining-routes-with-the-pages-folder) on how to create the homepage:

- **static locale**: Use this if you plan to have a different layout for each locale. Layout means different components or 
    different order of components.
- **dynamic locale**: Use this if you plan to have the same layout for each locale but different translations and content.

This differentiation is only about page layout not about the content inside the components. 

## Static locale

For each site language create a folder named with the language code.
The homepage is defined in `index.astro` files inside this folders.
For example when your page needs to support English and German, create:

- `src/pages/en/index.astro`
- `src/pages/de/index.astro`

Every `index.astro` file has this initial structure:

```astro title="src/pages/en/index.astro"
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    {/* Add components and HTML here */}
</Page>
```

<Aside type="tip">
Although this solution could use hard wired texts, we recommend using translation keys
to have all translated text in one place. This simplifies translation management when adding a new language.
</Aside>


## Dynamic locale

Create one file named `src/pages/[locale]/index.astro. The homepage for all locales is 
defined inside this file.
This is the basic layout:

```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/index.astro"
---
export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n"
import { Page } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    {/* Add components and HTML here */}
</Page>
```

<Aside type="tip">
Use `Astro.currentLocale` to change the content based on the locale.
</Aside>


## Add components

Add components to your homepage. These components are available.

- [Section](/build/pages/section): used to structure the page and take care of the layout of other components or any HTML.  
  Components that include the suffix `Section` in their title already include this.
- [Hero Section](/build/pages/hero-section): a big image, optionally with a title inside, that serves as an eye-catcher, normally at the top of a page.
- [Media Gallery Section](/build/pages/media-gallery-section): shows a selection of media items in a gallery view.
- [Categories Section](/build/pages/categories-section): displays a grid of all available categories, each leading to a search page filtered by category.
- [Search Section](/build/pages/search-section): displays a full search interface, including filters and matching results.
- [Highlight Section](/build/pages/highlight-section): combination of a large image, headline, text, and optionally a link button.
- [Video Player](/build/pages/video-player): a video player for YouTube, Vimeo links, or MP4 files.
- [Custom Components](/build/pages/custom-components): your own Astro components. You are very welcome to share them with the community â€”
