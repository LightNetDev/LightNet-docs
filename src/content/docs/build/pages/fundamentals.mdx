This chapter introduces how pages are created with LightNet. Most of the concepts presented are Astro concepts, 
use the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) for deeper insights.

## Defining Routes with the Pages Folder

Routes on your LightNet site are determined by the files in the `src/pages` folder. 
The file path directly maps to the page route. 
For instance, a file at `src/pages/en/about.astro` corresponds to `https://your.site/en/about`.

LightNet also automatically adds:

- **Homepage Redirect**: Visiting the root path (`https://your.site`) redirects to the homepage in the default site language.
- **Search Page**: Lists all media items at `[locale]/media`.
- **Details Pages**: Displays details of a media item at `[locale]/media/[id]`.
- **404 Page**: Shown when a non-existent page is accessed, at `/404`.


All pages (except `404` and `/`) 
reside in folders defining their [locale](/build/i18n/fundamentals). 

There are two different types of locale folders: **static** and **dynamic**. You can use both inside the same project.

<Aside type="note">
Static and dynamic routes are based on [Astro's routing concept](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/).

### Static Locale Folder

Create separate folders for each locale, like `src/pages/en/` and `src/pages/de/`. 
This approach allows for completely unique page structures per language.
For example you could build an English homepage starting with gallery and a German homepage starting with a text.

Use static locale folders when:
- Rendering Markdown content for different locales.
- Customizing page layouts for each locale.
- You only need to support one language.

### Dynamic Locale Folder

Create a single folder for all locales, named `src/pages/[locale]/` (use exactly this name for the folder). 
The `[locale]` placeholder is resolved by Astro during the build process, 
using a `getStaticPaths` function exported by each page in this folder.

To provide a `getStaticPaths` function with all locales use our helper function `getLocalePaths`:

```astro title="src/pages/[locale]/some-page.astro"
---
export { getLocalePaths as getStaticPaths } from "lightnet/i18n";
---
```

<Aside type="tip">
To access the current locale within a dynamic folder, use `Astro.currentLocale`.
</Aside>

Use dynamic locale folders for pages with the same structure but different translations.

## File Layout

Here's a basic layout for a LightNet page file:

```astro title="some-page.astro"
---
import { Page } from "lightnet/components";
---
<Page>
    {/* Add components and HTML here */}
</Page>
```

- The frontmatter (inside `---`) runs during the build, used for imports and variable definitions.
- Below the frontmatter is the page content. You can insert HTML and any Astro component including LightNet's reusable components.

LightNet's `Page` component ensures consistent layout, adding headers, language switchers, and navigation menus.

### File to URL Mapping

Each component inside the `src/pages` folder maps to an HTML file in the output directory, based on its filename:

- `src/pages/en/index.astro` → `/en/index.html`
- `src/pages/en/about.astro` → `/en/about/index.html`
- `src/pages/en/info.md` → `/en/info/index.html`

<Aside type="note">
Notice how Astro generates `index.html` files. Browsers serve `index.html` when accessing a folder path. 
This simplifies URLs (e.g., `https://your.site/en/about` instead of `https://your.site/en/about.html`).
