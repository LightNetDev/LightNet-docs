The `CategoriesSection` component is used to display a grid of all available categories. It already includes a `Section` 
component to handle the layout. Clicking on a category navigates to the search page filtered by the category.

![Image Categories Section](./images/categories.webp)

Here is an example on how to use it:

```astro
---
import { Page, CategoriesSection } from "lightnet/components"
---
<Page>
    <CategoriesSection />
</Page>
```

## Reference

The `CategoriesSection` component has the following properties:

### `title`

type: `string` \
example: `"Categories"` \
required: `false` \
default: `Astro.locals.i18n.t("ln.common.categories")`

The title of the categories section. By default the title is translated from the `ln.common.categories` key (this is "Categories" in English).
In case you want to use a different title, you can set the `title` property.
