LightNet enables building websites in your community's language, supporting multiple languages, including right-to-left languages.
It is highly recommended to understand LightNet's implementation of internationalization, even if you're supporting just one language.

## Two Layers of Language

LightNet sites have two layers of language (which may be identical):

- **Content Language**: The language of media items. For instance, an English video has an English title and description.
- **Site Language**: The language of the user interface, including button labels, menus, and page text.

Both are configured using the `languages` setting in `astro.config.mjs`. All listed languages are available as content languages. 
For site languages, explicitly set either `isDefaultSiteLanguage` or `isSiteLanguage` to `true`.


```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          label: "English",
          isDefaultSiteLanguage: true
        },
        {
          code: "de",
          label: "German"
        }
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Language Configuration Properties

- **`code`**: The language identifier using [IETF BCP-47 tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `es` for Spanish). 
  [This tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/), google or chat-gpt might be helping you with this.
- **`label`**: The display name for the language selector. This can be a static string (e.g., `Espa√±ol`) or a translation key (e.g., `x.languages.es`).
- The **`isDefaultSiteLanguage`** is the primary site language for visitors and the fallback for translations. Exactly one language must be set as default.
- Additional site languages can be defined by setting `isSiteLanguage` to `true`.

## Route Localization

Every page of a LightNet site is available for all configured site languages. To enable this 
all page routes start with a `locale`. The locale references the `code` defined in the languages config. For example 
an English About page could be available on `https://your.site/en/about`.

## Translating Pages in LightNet

To implement translations, LightNet uses translation keys that are mapped to translation values based on the current locale. 
A translation key is used inside an Astro component like this:

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
<h1>{Astro.locals.i18n.t("x.homepage.title")}</h1>
```

The translate function `Astro.locals.i18n.t` is available in all Astro files. 
It maps the translation key to the value based on the current locale, derived from the page's URL path.

The translate function is implemented by using the external library i18next. Checkout the [i18next docs](https://www.i18next.com/) to learn 
how they support plurals, context, interpolation...

### Translation Files

Translations are stored in `src/translations/`, with one file per site language named `[language-code].yml`.
This is how the english translation file of our example above could look like:

```yml title="src/translations/en.yml"
# Optional description...
x.homepage.title: Welcome to my page!
```

<Aside type="tip">
Enclose the translation values in quotes if they contain special characters, such as `:`, `#` or `-`. 
</Aside>

- The translation key is on the left, and the translation value is on the right.
- Use periods (`.`) in keys to add context (e.g., `x.homepage.title`).

LightNet uses the same mechanism to translate built-in strings for example the title on the search page (`ln.search.title`).
All translation keys used by LightNet are defined in the [built-in English translation file](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/blob/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations/en.yml) on GitHub. 
This file is always up to date.
Next to the English translation files you find other translations for LightNet. They are maintained by the community - you are welcome to [contribute your
translations](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/tree/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations).

By convention all of LightNet's built-in translation keys start with `ln.`. You should start your custom translation keys with `x.`. 

### Translation Resolution Order

LightNet resolves translation keys in the following order:

1. Merge custom and built-in translations, with custom values taking precedence.
2. Check the translation file for the exact current locale.
3. Fallback to the base language (e.g., `en` for `en_US`).
4. Use any `fallbackLanguages` defined for the current language.
5. Fallback to the default site language.
6. Lastly, fallback to English translations.
7. If unresolved, return the key. If the key starts with `ln.` or `x.`, an error is thrown.
