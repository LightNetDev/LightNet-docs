LightNet enables building websites in your community's language, supporting multiple languages, including right-to-left languages. Internationalization is a core feature, essential even if you're supporting just one language.

## Two Layers of Language

LightNet sites can have two distinct language layers (which may be identical):

- **Content Language**: The language of a media item. For instance, an English video will have an English title and description.
- **Site Language**: The language of the user interface, including button labels, menus, and page text.

Both are configured using the `languages` setting in `astro.config.mjs`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import lightnet from "lightnet";
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    lightnet({
      languages: [
        {
          code: "en",
          label: "English",
          isDefaultSiteLanguage: true
        },
        {
          code: "de",
          label: "German"
        }
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Language Configuration Properties

- **`code`**: The language identifier using [IETF BCP-47 tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `es` for Spanish). Use [this tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) if unsure.
- **`label`**: The display name for the language selector. This can be a static string (e.g., `Español`) or a translation key (e.g., `x.languages.es`).

All listed languages are available as content languages. For site languages, explicitly set either `isDefaultSiteLanguage` or `isSiteLanguage` to `true`.

- The **default site language** is the primary language for visitors and the fallback for translations. Exactly one language must be set as default.
- Additional site languages can be defined by setting `isSiteLanguage` to `true`.

## Routing

Every page of a LightNet site is available for all configured site languages. To enable this 
all page routes start with a `locale`. The locale references the `code` defined in the languages config. For example 
an English About page could be available on `https://your.site/en/about`.

## Translating Pages in LightNet

To enable translations LightNet uses translation keys. A translation key is used inside an Astro component like this:

```astro title="MyComponent.astro"
<h1>{Astro.locals.i18n.t("x.homepage.title")}</h1>
```

The translate function `Astro.locals.i18n.t` is available in all Astro files. 
It maps the translation key to the value based on the current locale, derived from the page's URL path.

### Translation Files

Translations are stored in `src/translations/`, with one file per site language named `[language-code].yml`.
This is how the english translation file of our example above could look like:

```yml title="src/translations/en.yml"
# Optional description...
x.homepage.title: Welcome to my page!
```

<Aside type="tip">
Usually, you don't need quotes around translation values.
</Aside>

- The translation key is on the left, and the translation value is on the right.
- Use periods (`.`) in keys to add context (e.g., `x.homepage.title`).

LightNet uses the same mechanism to translate builtin strings for example the title on the search page (`ln.search.title`).
All translation keys used by LightNet are defined in the [builtin English translation file](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/blob/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations/en.yml) on GitHub. This file will always be up to date.
Next to the English translation files you find other translations for LightNet. They are maintained by the community - you are welcome to [contribute your
translations](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/tree/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations).

By convention all of LightNet's builtin translation keys start with `ln.`. You should start your custom translation keys with `x.`. 

### Translation Resolution Order

LightNet resolves translation keys in the following order:

1. Merge custom and built-in translations, with custom values taking precedence.
2. Check the translation file for the exact current locale.
3. Fallback to the base language (e.g., `en` for `en_US`).
4. Use any `fallbackLanguages` defined for the current language.
5. Fallback to the default site language.
6. Lastly, fallback to English translations.
7. If unresolved, return the key. If the key starts with `ln.` or `x.`, an error is thrown.
