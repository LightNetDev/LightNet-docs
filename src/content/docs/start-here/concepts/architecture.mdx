This chapter provides a high-level overview of the concept LightNet uses to build media sites. 
It explores the principle of static site generation and explains why and how this approach aligns with LightNet.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

LightNet utilizes [**static site generation (SSG)**](/build/astro) to create media sites. 
SSG is a method of pre-building a website by converting raw content (e.g., [Markdown, JSON, or YAML](/start-here/guides/essential-skills) files) 
into static [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](/start-here/guides/essential-skills) files. 
This process involves:

1. **Content and Data** - Website content is stored in structured, easily manageable files.
2. **Templates** - Predefined layouts determine the visual structure of each page.
3. **Build Process** - A build command compiles content and templates into fully rendered static files.
4. **Deployment** - These static files are then hosted on a web server or distributed via a CDN.

### Why LightNet Uses SSG

SSG provides advantages that make it an ideal choice for LightNet-powered sites:

- **Simplified Deployment** - Traditional websites require a running backend, but LightNet sites consist of simple static files, 
    reducing complexity.
- **Faster Performance** - Pages are pre-rendered during the build process, eliminating unnecessary rerendering and reducing 
    data transmission.
- **Enhanced Security** - Without a backend application, the attack surface is significantly reduced, lowering the risk of hacks.
- **Lower Maintenance** - Static files are more reliable than backend applications, which can crash or require frequent updates.
- **Minimal Hosting Costs** - Hosting static files is extremely affordable, with some providers offering free hosting options.

### Limitations of SSG

While SSG has many advantages, it also has limitations:

- **No Dynamic Content** - LightNet does not support personalized content or user-based media permissions out of the box.
- **Limited Interactivity** - Highly interactive features like real-time chats and comment sections require external solutions.

However, LightNet offers flexibility by allowing the integration of dynamic components when needed.

## How LightNet Uses SSG

LightNet builds upon existing SSG tools and streamlines the process:

1. **Content and Data** - LightNet defines a structured format for media content, stored as plain text files. 
    This ensures easy import/export compatibility with other systems.
2. **Templates** - Prebuilt layouts and UI components speed up development and provide a professional appearance out of the box.
3. **Build Process** - LightNet leverages state-of-the-art tools to transform data and templates into a fully functional static 
    media site.
4. **Deployment** - LightNet provides deployment guidance, ensuring that sites remain infrastructure-agnostic. If users need 
    recommendations, LightNet suggests best-practice hosting solutions.

By combining the power of static site generation with flexible deployment options, LightNet enables users to build efficient, 
scalable, and cost-effective media sites with ease.
