LightNet is built using web technologies. 
While we strive to keep things simple, there are some essential technologies you should be familiar with:

- **HTML (Basic Knowledge)** - A basic understanding of HTML structure is essential. Learn more in this [HTML Overview](https://web.dev/learn/html/overview).
- **JavaScript (Basic Knowledge)** - While LightNet doesn't require complex JavaScript, being familiar with
    [JavaScript's syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Adding_interactivity) will be beneficial.
- **JSON (Good Understanding)** - Configuration and content data are stored in [JSON files](https://learnxinyminutes.com/json/). 
- **Git (Basic Knowledge)** - Version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) is important for collaboration and managing changes, 
    especially when configuring LightNet's optional Administration User Interface.
- **Command Line (Basic Knowledge)** - You should know how to navigate directories and execute commands.
- **NPM (Basic Knowledge)** - Many project tasks, such as installing dependencies or building your site, 
    are done via the command line using the [NPM package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager). 
- **Astro (Good Understanding)** - LightNet is built on the [Astro framework](https://astro.build). 
    Understanding Astro's project structure and static site generation features helps you get the most out of LightNet.

Even if you're new to these technologies, LightNet's beginner-friendly setup makes it easy to get started. 
As your project grows, developing these skills enables deeper customization and more advanced functionality.

AI tools, for example [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [Duck.ai](https://duck.ai), might help you to navigate these technologies.
