Welcome to the LightNet Developer Documentation! 
This guide will walk you through creating your first LightNet project. 
Not sure what LightNet is all about? [Visit the LightNet homepage](https://lightnet.community).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 22 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com)
- **Text Editor** - We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official [Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

To verify your installations, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
git --version
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're ready to go!

## 1. Set up the example template

We recommend starting with the [example-template](https://github.com/LightNetDev/example-template), a prebuilt template that showcases LightNet's 
features for a fictional skateboard ministry. It's a great starting point for learning how to structure your media library.

To create a local copy of the project -  navigate your terminal to a folder where you would like to create the copy and run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template LightNetDev/example-template
```

This starts [Astro's](https://docs.astro.build/) `create astro` command - which lets you:


- Choose a location for your project. This creates the folder for your project and also set its name.
- Install its dependencies (`Yes`).
- Initialize a Git repository (`Yes`).

Once finished, navigate into your project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-folder
```

## 2. Run the development server

Now that your project is set up, start the development server to see your site in action.
The development server is an application that lets you preview your media site in your browser without putting it online.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site is available at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). Open your browser to preview the example site.
As you will need the development server for the next steps, please keep it running.

## 3. Make your first modification

As your first modification, let's change the site title:

<Steps>
  1. Open the project folder in VS Code (or your preferred text editor).
  1. Inside VS-Code open `src/translations/en.yml`. 
  1. Modify the value of the `x.site.title`-key by changing "SkateNet" to your desired site name.
  1. Save the file. Still running `npm run dev`, your browser automatically
  refreshes to show the updated title. It is visible in front of the big picture and inside the header bar.
</Steps>

### Optional: make another modification using the Administration UI

You can easily update content using the [experimental Administration User Interface](/content/administration-ui) (Administration UI). The 
Administration UI is a graphical user interface that enables a content manager to update the media site's content without
accessing the source code. Follow these steps to run the Administration UI:

<Steps>
  1. Ensure that `npm run dev` is still running in your terminal. 
  2. Open a new terminal window in your project's folder and execute the following command. This
     command downloads and starts a backend for Decap CMS, which is used for the
     content Administration UI.
      ```bash
      npx decap-server
      ```
  3. Once you see the message `info: Decap CMS Proxy Server listening on port 8081` in your terminal, open your browser and
     navigate to the Administration UI on [localhost:4321/admin](http://localhost:4321/admin). 
  4. Click the "Login" button. You are presented with a list of all available media
     items. 
  5. Open `how-to-360-flip--en` by clicking it. Change the title to "How to
  Do a 360 Flip". 
  6. Click the "Publish" button in the header bar, then select
  "Publish Now".
</Steps>

This action updates the a [JSON content file](/content/fundamentals) stored on inside your project folder.

Inspect the changes you have just made:

<Steps>
  1. **Check the Updated Content File**: Open the file located at
  `/src/content/media/how-to-360-flip--en.json`. The `title` attribute should
  reflect your changes. 
  2. **View the Updated Website**: In your browser, go to
  [localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en](http://localhost:4321/en/media/how-to-360-flip--en).
  You should see the updated title displayed below the video.
</Steps>

Feel free to experiment further by adding new media items through the Administration UI or by creating additional JSON files.

Stop a running terminal application with the keyboard combination `Control` - `C`.
