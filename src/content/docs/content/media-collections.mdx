Use media collections to group media items that belong together. For example a video playlist, a series of sermons, 
a music album or a book series can be modeled as a media collection.

Media Collections show up on the details page of a media item. Allowing your user to quickly navigate to other media items 
of the same collection. They can also be used for generating a gallery of media items on the homepage.

Here is an example of a media collection:

```json title="src/content/media-collections/sermon-series-1.json"
{
  "label": "Sermon Series 1"
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
Media items can be part of several collections and can be ordered within a collection by setting an index for the collection 
in the media item file.

## Reference

Media collections have this property:

### label

type: `string` \
example: `"Sermon Series 1"` \
required: `true`

The name of the media collection. The label can either be a fixed string or a translation key to support multiple locales.
