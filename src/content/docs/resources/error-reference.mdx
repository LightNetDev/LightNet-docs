This page lists common warnings and error messages you may encounter when using LightNet, along with explanations and suggested fixes.

## ⚠️ Missing or Empty Content Directory

You might see warnings like these in your terminal:

```
[WARN] [glob-loader] The base directory "/src/content/categories/" does not exist.
```

```
[WARN] [glob-loader] No files found matching "*.json" in directory "src/content/media-collections"
```

```
[glob-loader] Reloaded data from media-item-xyz.json
The collection "categories" does not exist or is empty. Please check your content config file for errors.
```

**What it means**

LightNet expects certain directories to exist in your project, such as:

- `src/content/categories/`
- `src/content/media-collections/`

These are used for loading structured content like categories and media collections. 
The warning means that Astro (via LightNet) tried to load content from one of these paths, but the directory was missing or empty.

**How to fix it**

- **If you don’t need this content**\
    You can safely ignore the warning. LightNet will continue working without that data.
- **If you do want to use categories or media collections**\
    Make sure the directories exist and are correctly named.
