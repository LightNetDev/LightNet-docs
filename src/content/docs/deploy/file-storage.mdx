Cloudflare Pages puts a limit of 25 MB on the size of each file.
This is our recommended way to handle large content files:

1. Try to optimize them if possible. Big files have a negative impact on the time to open them.
1. Use video hosts like YouTube or Vimeo to upload your videos (if they are safe to use in your context).
1. Use Backblaze for large files that cannot be uploaded elsewhere.

## How to use Backblaze

<Steps>
1. **Create a Backblaze Account**: Sign up at [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com).
2. **Create a Backblaze Bucket**: In the Backblaze dashboard, create a new bucket and upload your files.
3. **Reference Your Backblaze URL**: Use the URL of the uploaded file as the media item's content URL in your media item JSON files.
4. **Configure Internal Domains**: Add your Backblaze domain to the internal domains configuration in `astro.config.mjs` to ensure proper handling of the files.
    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={3}
    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      internalDomains: ["your-backblaze-domain.com"],
    });
    ```
</Steps>

You can also use Cloudflare
to proxy requests to your Backblaze bucket. By doing so, you can 
use a custom subdomain on your file URLs e.g. `https://files.your-ministry.com/a-book-about-love.pdf`.
