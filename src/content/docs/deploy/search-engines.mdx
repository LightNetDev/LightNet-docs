## Remove your media library from search engines

If you do not want to appear on Google or other search engines,
you can ask them not to index your site. 

Do this by adding a `/public/robots.txt` file to your project folder,
containing this content:

```txt title="/public/robots.txt"
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

<Aside>
Search engines and other bots on the internet 
are not forced to respect this file.
