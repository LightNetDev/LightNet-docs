Keep your media library up to date by following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Check your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm outdated
    ```
2. Read the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/lightnetdev/lightnet/releases)
3. Update your dependencies by running
    ```bash
    npm update
    ```
    This updates your dependencies to the latest version according to the [version specifiers](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update) 
    inside `package.json`.
4.  There are changes that are not updated automatically, so called major releases (first position of the version number is increased). 
    Major releases might **break their compatibility** with your project. LightNet depends on other packages e.g. Astro and Tailwind CSS. 
    You must not major update these dependencies unless the LightNet release notes tell you to do so. The LightNet project will follow their 
    release and introduce major updates from time to time. If there is a new major LightNet release do the following:
    1. Update your project to latest LightNet major release: Inside `package.json` change the version numbers to match the latest LightNet version. Keep the `^` suffix 
        to support minor and patch updates with `npm update`.
    1. Install the updated LightNet dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    1. Check the [LightNet release notes](https://github.com/lightnetdev/lightnet/releases) to see what additional changes are needed for your project.
        This might include updating major version numbers of other packages. In this case update their version numbers in `package.json` and execute `npm install` again.
    1. Follow the release notes to adjust your project to LightNet's changes.
</Steps>

<Aside>
LightNet follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This means you can update your dependencies to the latest minor 
version without breaking your site.
