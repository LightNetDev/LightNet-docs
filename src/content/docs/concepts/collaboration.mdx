## How to Work with LightNet

This chapter outlines how to collaborate with the LightNet community, contribute to its development, and get support when needed.

## The Structure of LightNet Development

LightNet operates with a clear separation between its core framework and the individual media sites built with it:

- **LightNet Software Development Kit (SDK)** - The core of LightNet is developed as an open-source project. 
    This SDK provides the essential tools and features needed to build and manage media sites.
- **Media Sites** - Each media site has its own independent codebase, utilizing the LightNet SDK as an external npm dependency. 
    While media sites primarily rely on the SDK, developers can extend functionality and add custom features specific to their project's needs.

## Contributing to LightNet

LightNet thrives on community collaboration. We encourage developers to contribute to the SDK GitHub repository to help improve the platform for everyone. Contributions can take various forms:

- **Feature Proposals** - Have an idea to enhance LightNet? Share your [feature proposal](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/issues/new?template=---02-feature-proposal.yml) with the community.
- **Bug Reports** - If you encounter an issue, [report the bug](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/issues/new?template=---01-bug-report.yml) so we can improve the system together.
- **Pull Requests** - Contribute directly by implementing [new features](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement), [fixing bugs](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug), or [improving documentation](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet-Docs).
- **Improve Translations** - [Submit your translations](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/issues/new?template=---03-translations-update.yml) to the SDK's built-in strings. Learn more on the [translations readme](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/tree/main/packages/lightnet/src/i18n/translations).

Our contribution guidelines can be found in LightNet's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LightNetDev/LightNet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Support & Getting Involved
